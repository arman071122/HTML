    <p>I am the night. The protector of Gotham City. By day, I am Bruce Wayne, a billionaire with a legacy, but when
        darkness falls, I become something elseâ€”something that the criminals fear. As Batman, I operate in the shadows,
        using my intellect, skills, and the resources at my disposal to uphold justice where the law has failed. I am
        driven by a deep sense of duty, haunted by the past, and determined to prevent others from experiencing the pain
        that shaped me. With no superpowers to rely on, I rely on my mind, my physical strength, and my unyielding
        willpower. I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to keep
        Gotham safe, even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.
